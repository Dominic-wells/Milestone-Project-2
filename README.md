# Design

## Site theme

I wanted to avoid using visual effects that would be too distacting to users keeping the theme of minimalist aesthetics.

## Structure

The site site will be a "One Pager" will all the information the users will need on one page

## Colour Scheme

I wanted to use blacks and grays giving a nice contrast for readers.

## Typography

Arimo was used with a default backup as sans-serif.
I used 'Nothing You Could Do' with cursive to give the text under the logo a hand written look.

## Skeleton

I produced digital wireframes using Balsamiq.

When producing my wireframes, I decided to develop my ideas in stages, I attempted to improve my designs naturally by reviewing the wireframes after completion and finding areas of improvement.

I developed wireframes for different platforms, desktop, tablet and mobile where used.

Balsamiq wireframe Designs:
