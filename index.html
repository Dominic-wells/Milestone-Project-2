    <h1 id="analyse">Passwords</h1>
    <p>
      Passwords are a critical part of information and network security. Passwords serve to protect against unauthorized
      access, but a poorly chosen password could put the entire institution at risk.<br>
    <p>What is a password? A password is your personal key to a computer system. Passwords help to ensure that only
      authorized individuals access computer systems. Passwords also help to determine accountability for all
      transactions and other changes made to system resources, including data. If you share your password with a
      colleague or friend, you may be giving an unauthorized individual access to the system and may be held responsible
      for their actions. What if the individual gives your password to someone else? What if some of your files are
      deleted or otherwise rendered unusable? Are you willing to take the blame if an unauthorized individual uses your
      access to damage or to make unauthorized changes to data or systems?</p>

    <P>Your password should not be the same as your username. Your password should be unique. Do not use the same
      password across multiple accounts.A good password is relatively easy to remember, but hard for somebody else to
      guess. There are a
      variety of techniques you can use to choose secure passwords. Listed below are some examples of creating
      passwords.</P>
    <h2>But generally:
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Passwords should be long and unique.</li>
      <li>Old passwords should not be re-used.</li>
      <li>All passwords should conform to the guidelines outlined below.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h2>Password Construction Guidelines</h2>
    <p>Poor, weak passwords are easily cracked, and put the entire system at risk. Therefore, strong passwords are
      required. Try to create a password that is also easy to remember.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Passwords should be long. A password should really be a passphrase. Uses spaces between words to make them
        longer and harder to crack, but easier to remember.</li>
      <li>Passwords should contain at least 12 characters.</li>
      <li>Passwords should contain at least 1 uppercase letter.</li>
      <li>Passwords should contain at least 1 lowercase letter.</li>
      <li>Passwords should contain at least 1 numerical character.</li>
      <li>Symbol characters are encouraged (e.g. @#$%^&!.)</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>Best Practice</h2>
      <br>
      <h2>Protect your password
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Don't tell anyone your password. Not the IT department at work, not your ISP, not your bank, no one. System
          administrators should never ask for your password. If someone does, consider it suspicious.</li>
        <li>Don't save your password when a website asks if you wish to save the password. This type of storage is not
          encrypted. It is rather simple to steal your password when stored in this way.</li>
        <li>Use a random password generator to create a unique secure pass phrase for each site you login to.
        </li>
        <li>Don't let anyone use your computer that you don't trust. Don't login to an important online account using
          someone elses computer. There are ways to steal your password using keystroke loggers or by dumping the
          memory.</li>
        <li>Use a different password for every website you have an account with. This way if someone steals your
          password they only will get to access one thing. At the least, have a separate password for accounts you don't
          care about and a stronger and unique one for online banking or other private accounts.</li>
        <li>Passwords should contain at least 1 lowercase letter.</li>
        <li>Use caution when choosing a way to do password recovery. If you have a dog that all of your friends know
          about perhaps using your dog's name as your password recovery question is a bad idea. If someone you know
          wants to hack your account, they can say they've lost the password and when the secret question comes up they
          will immediately know the answer and access your account.</li>
        <li>Only use secure methods of login such as HTTPS. Never use your secret key on a page that is just using HTTP.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Ways a password is hacked
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Passwords can be stolen. Either over the network through an insecure channel such as HTTP or from grabbing
          your saved passwords file or simply by looking over your shoulder as you type. They can also be stolen if
          hackers steal the password file of a company you have an account with.</li>
        <li>Passwords can be guessed. Don't use your name, address, birthday or favorite video game. These will be
          easily guessable by others. Use a good generator instead.</li>
        <li>Dictionary attack. This is an attack where a computer will try every word in the dictionary to see if it's
          your password. This type of attack often substitutes "O" for "0" or "i" with "1". It also can put one or two
          digits at the end of every word quite quickly too. Protect against this by never using words in a dictionary
          or any words similar to dictionary words. By using a strong random generator, you protect yourself from this.
        </li>
        <li>Password cracking and brute force techniques. This is where every combination of password is attempted.
          Starting with "a", "b", "c" then going up to "aaaa", "aaab", "aaac" etc. Eventually every combination of
          letters, numbers and characters will be tried and the password will be broken. To combat against this, simply
          choose a longer password. Brute force attacks can take a very long time (years) if the password is just 15
          characters long.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Using a random password generator
      </h2>
      <P>This strong password generator tool using the <a href="https://passwordwolf.com/" target="_blank">PasswordWolf
          api</a>
        passwordwolf.api on this site can be used to create random, secure, and strong passwords.
        The generator uses javascript which must be enabled in the browser for the tool to work. The generator creates
        the password on the client side so that none of the passwords are sent over the Internet to be sniffed.</P>
